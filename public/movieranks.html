<h1>Diego's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>Diego ranks his top 3 movies. </h2>

<h3>Number 1: Interstellar</h3>
<p> From the plot to the acting, Interstellar is, in my opinion, one of the best movies to come out of the 2010's.
    The creative plot had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire movie. One thing about this movie that I admire 
    is how many times I can watch this movie without getting bored. That earns it an A+ from me.

<h3>Number 2: The Gladiator</h3>
<p>A historical fiction movie that sets place in Ancient Rome during the rule of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. The movie
    follows Maximus, a former Roman General turned slave/Gladiator who seeks vengeance on Commodus for killing Maximus' family 
    in a moment of jealous rage. Overall, it has great acting and immersive visuals that take you back to Ancient Rome.

<h3>Number 3: Troy</h3>
<p>Another historical fiction that sets place in Ancient Greece. This movie very loosely tells the tale of Homer's 
    epic 'The Illiad'. It summarizes the entirety of the epic with great acting and great scenes of battle. A great historical
    fiction that I will always enjoy watching.
